1 Router
1 Switch
25 PCs (5 for each of the 5 VLANs)
1 Trunk Link between the router and switch
All PCs should have IP addresses assigned manually within appropriate subnets


Scenario 6: VLAN Segmentation & VLAN Routing
You are a network engineer assigned to configure a small office network that separates departments using VLANs. The organization requires secure and structured communication between specific departments while allowing access to a Finance department from all others. Your job is to segment the network using VLANs and set up inter-VLAN routing using a single router.
Create VLANs for the following departments:

HR (VLAN 10)
Sales (VLAN 20)
DEV (VLAN 30)
PR (VLAN 40)
Finance (VLAN 50)

Assign 5 PCs to each VLAN.
Configure a trunk link between the router and the switch to allow VLAN-tagged traffic.
Set up Router-on-a-Stick on the router to enable inter-VLAN routing.
